Let us assume, we are presented with a fictional scenario, in which we need to build a Bloom filter to detect dangerous viral DNAs, given limited amount of storage.
Imagine we have to build a device with DNA sensors. The device is deployed in remote location without much power (other than solar) and resources (not a lot of computing power and RAM).
The device constantly gets DNA inputs from the environment via its sensors. And if it detects a known dangerous virus, it will send a signal back to the control station, alerting people of the danger.
